<p>HyRise is the official Kult Rising modpack for Hytale, that brings the Sxlaris Canon of the SCP Foundation into Hytale. 
HyRise is designed to be a much more laid back and less serious version of the Kult Rising experience, aiming less for being perfectly accurate to canon, and more for satisfying/relaxing gameplay loops. </p>

Convergence is an SMP project that may eventually be turned into a playable map as well. Convergence SMP was originally a minecraft server I ran back around 2018 with my friends. Eventually everyone but me stopped playing minecraft, so it eventually stopped being an SMP and went back to just being a singleplayer world.

But the general loose lore of convergence was basically meant to be the Void from Marvel's Loki. In other words, the world of Convergence is "a metaphysical junkyard where anything useless goes before it gets annihilated forever." So we were in the process of building an enormous Attack on Titan wall with a full titan looming over it, my main base was the bath house from Spirited away, but Howl's moving castle had crashed into it, we were building tattooine off in the far desert and things like that, which was meant to create that feeling of "metaphysical junkyard."

I had taken a break from minecraft for a few years, and my intent was always to come back to Convergence and start a proper series on youtube, and like I've talked about before i never like starting new worlds, if i want to start over, I just go to a far corner of the world with nothing and start from scratch there. So i knew I wanted the series to happen in the main Convergence world, but I didn't just want to start episode 1 off with me having this enormous world with multiple bases, automated farms, and endgame loot, because that makes everything feel a little cheap and unearned. So my plan, was to build a huge prison (think Parrot and Wifies Paragon) with a series of gates, and I would need to effectively beat all of minecraft while stuck inside of the prison, and once I had finished all of the challenges, I would escape the prison and be able to play in the full world. That way the beginning of the series would still feel like a proper survival start, but it would be condensed down and wouldn't need me to start a whole new world.
