<p>HyRise is the official Kult Rising modpack for Hytale, that brings the Sxlaris Canon of the SCP Foundation into Hytale. 
HyRise is designed to be a much more laid back and less serious version of the Kult Rising experience, aiming less for being perfectly accurate to canon, and more for satisfying/relaxing gameplay loops. </p>
